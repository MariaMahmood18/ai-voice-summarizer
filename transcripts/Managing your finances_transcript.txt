 Your time at university will probably be one of the most enjoyable and productive periods of your life, and you alone are responsible for making the most of this amazing opportunity. The Student Life Handbook by Christine Phantom is full of practical advice and tips on topics such as finding a place to live, managing your money, balancing your social life and your study, and keeping yourself and your belongings safe. This short audio file deals with the issue of money, one of the most pressing concerns for almost every student. My student loan went into my bank and I looked at the total and thought, well hey, I'm loaded. But then I sat down and I divided the money in my bank by the number of weeks I was going to be at uni that year. Suddenly it didn't seem so much anymore. I found when I went to uni for the first time that I had just no idea what things cost. My mum had always done my shopping at home. I hadn't even thought about stupid things like photocopying fees and late night taxes back from town. Managing your finances comes down to two basic elements, the money that's going into your bank account and the money that's coming out of it. There's lots of advice in the Student Life Handbook on how to maximise the money coming in, including information on the support that's available to you, hints on applying for sponsorship or scholarships, getting the most out of your student loan, borrowing money from other sources at the best rates and finding a part-time job that pays well and fits around your studies. But unless you're very lucky or very rich, you will also need to keep a close eye on your expenditure, the money that's coming out of your account over the course of the term, and that's what we'll focus on here. The single best way to stay on top of your money is to set yourself a budget and stick to it. At the start of each term, sit down and estimate your likely expenditure, including accommodation, tuition fees, travel costs, bills, books and miscellaneous costs such as birthday presents for friends and family. Deduct this from the money that will be going into your account from your grant, student loan, parental contribution, wages and so on. Once you have an idea of how much money you'll have left over to live on after you've paid for all these essentials, you can set yourself a weekly budget for food, living expenses and entertainment. Bear in mind that the NUS estimated the cost of the 2004-5 academic year to be £10,186 in London and £8,584 outside London. So if your estimate of costs is much below that, you might want to give yourself a little extra time to think about it. You might want to give your figures a reality check. One of the biggest changes I had to make when going to university was my spending awareness. I had to teach myself how to budget for necessities such as food, clothes and theatre visits. I really learned the hard way. I ended up living on toast in the spring term because all my loan had gone on my accommodation and Christmas presents. Budgeting has been really difficult. Even though I've held down a part-time job for three years, there just doesn't seem to be enough money. Some things have to give. I don't buy that many clothes and I only go out at the weekend. Running a car whilst being at university has been hard, but it's worth it for the freedom and independence it gives me. It's important to balance work, study and going out. When I was living in halls in the first year I was spending £75 on food, £60 going out and £25 for my mobile phone bill. That was roughly what I earned working seven hours a week plus overtime. This sort of budget doesn't really allow for going out every night, but it's what I accepted as part of taking control of my spending to avoid getting into debt, apart from my student loan, which I think would be much worse than spending a few nights in with a good film and pizza. But it's much, much easier to set a budget than to stick to it. Here are a few tips from students to help you stretch your limited funds that bit further so you don't have to spend a term living on toast. Don't succumb to impulse buys. If you don't really need the item, don't buy it at all. If you do need it, make sure you shop around to get the best deal, or better yet, wait for the sales or a special offer. Or drop hints to family or friends if your birthday is coming up. Once you've spent your going out budget for the week, don't go out. It doesn't cost much to have friends over for coffee or to share a cheap bottle of wine. It costs even less just to stay in and actually do some studying. Ask for a student discount, even if it's not advertised. Oh, and remember to keep your NUS Card Review as proof. It's amazing how often you can get 10% or even 20% off. If you've gone out with your mates, arrange to meet up at someone's flat first and spend the first part of the evening there. It's so much cheaper drinking at home than you can go out later and still have a laugh without spending as much. If you're on a budget, it's very tempting to live on chips and fast food special deals, especially if you're not very good at cooking. But I did that for the first few weeks and I felt terrible. I put on loads of weight and I always felt tired. My mum gave me a cookbook and I have a few really easy dishes that I can cook that don't cost very much. Mainly pasta bakes. I can make one pasta bake last three or four days. Once you've set your budget and you're doing your best to stick to it, you'll find that keeping a basic income and expenditure record so that you can see exactly where your money's going is an enormous help. You don't need a fancy accounting package, just a notebook in which you record your bank balance week by week with a summary of what you spend and how you spend it. If you do online banking so much the better. Get into the habit of downloading statements once a week and comparing them with your budget. Not only will this tell you if you're on budget or if you've blown it, it will help you identify exactly where your money's going so that you can work out where you can make savings in the future. It's also a habit that will stand you in good stead for the rest of your life. Many students find it helpful to set up two separate bank accounts. They pay income from student loans, student support, parental contributions, wages and so on into a high rate interest account, then feed funds from this into a current account for week to week living expenses. Not only does this help to stop money vanishing unexpectedly, it also allows you to earn interest on your money before you spend it. If you're a non-tax payer, you should fill in form R85, available from your local tax office, to make sure that any interest you earn is tax free.

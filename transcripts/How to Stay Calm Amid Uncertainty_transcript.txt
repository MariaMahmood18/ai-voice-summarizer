 Hi everyone, here is Icato Vargas and this is the 5 Minutes Podcast. And today I want to talk about a topic that seems simple, but is one of the biggest challenges for any project manager. Staying calm when everything seems to fall apart, when volatility just takes over of everything we do in the project. And it's easy to lose control when our project is delayed or clients change their mind or the budget starts to blow up. In those moments the feeling of chaos takes over and common sense, really common sense, is usually the first thing to go away. So I want to give you some tips on how I manage when this type of volatility or this type of uncertainty takes place in the projects I'm managing. So the first tip is do a reality check. Pause for a moment and ask yourself honestly, what is really at risk? What is the worst case scenario? What is actually under my control right now? What can I do right now? This kind of analysis helps you move away from emotion and bring the facts back into focus. The second tip, it separates emotions from operations. Everyone and this I can tell for my personal life. Even working with projects for decades I feel anxious many, many times when I'm facing challenges. But remember, decisions made in the heat of the moment, they tend to create even more problems. So it's very important that you create a small pause ritual. I love the concept that many negotiators say it's called go to the balcony. It's go away from the discussion and try to analyze the situation as someone outside the situation, like in the balcony. Watching a theater happening where you are one of the actors. And during this time take a deep breath, maybe grab a coffee or a tea or step out of the room for a couple of minutes and then you will come back with more clarity and mainly much less impulse. The third tip I want to share with you is to go back to the basics of the project you are managing. Yes, go back to the basics. Go to the scope, to the main milestones and the agreed objectives. Many times the confusion comes from too much noise and honestly noise is nowadays probably far more evident than the real information. And reconnecting with the foundation will help you to refocus on the reason and the purpose of the work you are doing. The fourth tip is talk to someone you trust. And this is something I really like to do. I have a couple of people that I truly trust and it could be a colleague, a sponsor or even a mentor. And these people help me to bring a more rational and less emotional perspective, helping myself to make much better decisions. The fifth tip is use communication as a stabilizing tool. Many people go silent and they just disappear when problems arise. And that only increases insecurity in the team and is a fertile soil for gossip and this type of communication. Even if you don't have all the answers, speak clearly, share what you know and show that a plan is in progress. Act calm, even if you are still figuring things out. You don't have all the solutions, but it's very important to say to people what you know and what would be your potential next steps. The sixth tip is to remember that every project goes through turbulence. No meaningful project reaches the finish without turbulence. It's part of the game. What sets you as a great project manager apart from the others is your ability to navigate those moments with balance and resilience. Remember one thing, if the project was easy, probably you would not be the project manager. The seventh tip is to have plans but accept uncertainty. Strategy planning is essential, but being too rigid in face of the unexpected will lead to frustration. You need to have the ability to adapt yourself to different circumstances. The eighth and final tip, it's simple but powerful. Take care of yourself. Sleep, eat well and take strategic breaks. This is not a luxury. It's a tool for productivity and mainly self-control. A burnt out project manager loses his or her school much faster. Staying calm does not mean denying the problem. It means choosing the best way to face it. I hope that these eight tips could be very helpful for you. Of course, maybe it sounds like a lot of tips, but they are very simple to explain and very hard to practice. So practice this. Try as soon as you see that things are getting a little bit out of control or you are turning on the panic mode. Think about these tips. I hope you truly enjoyed this episode and see you next week with another 5-Minutes Podcast.

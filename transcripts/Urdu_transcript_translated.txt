I can't be the last person who ever told me that I'm going to be a victim of my death and that I'm not going to tell myself what I'm going through, and I'm going to tell myself what I'm going to do with my life, and I'm not able to tell myself what I'm going to do in Christianity, and I'm going to tell myself what I'm going to do with my life and what I'm trying to do in my life.
